The plugin version mirrors the markdown-it library version!

This is a WikiLabs plugin for parsing Markdown text, based on the [[markdown-it|https://markdown-it.github.io/]] project.

It is completely self-contained, and doesn't need an Internet connection in order to work. It works both in the browser and under Node.js.
