''Important:'' This plugin takes precedence over the core webDav PUT saver!

This saver uses `last-modified` and `if-unmodified-since` HTTP header attributes, to detect file inconsistencies,
which allows the server to activate server-side file compression. 

The core PUT saver uses etags, which don't work, if server-side file compression is active.
