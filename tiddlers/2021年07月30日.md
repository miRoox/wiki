* `KERNEL_CHECKPOINT` problem can be fixed by
  1. add `setup_kernel_checkpoint` before work start
  2. add `sof-kernel-log-check.sh "$KERNEL_CHECKPOINT"` before `exit`

* `check-pause-release-suspend-resume.sh`  provide option `-F` for file but never use (always `$dummy_file`)

* ci sof-framework

next week plan:

* ramp up CI
* take some of platforms, deal with the issues on those platforms
* setup new device (if possible)
