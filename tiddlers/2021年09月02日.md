SOF driver architecture introduction:

* ASoC Layer
  * Codec independent
  * DAPM (Dynamic Audio Power Management)
  * Platform class Drivers
    * 
  * Machine class Drivers: 
    * Connect CPU & Codec: DAI_LINK
    * Configure input/output
    * Set Jack
  * Codec class Drivers
  * Generic IPC driver
    * IPC TX: Power up DSP -> Intial message and attach data -> Send message -> Get reply in time
    * IPC RX: Read header 
* SOF Linux Driver (Platform Driver)
* SOF Driver Probe
  * Codec Driver Probe is parallel
    * if driver haven't probe when register machine driver, register machine driver will return a retry code(517)
  * Find machine drive: i2s -> soundwire -> HDA
* 

rewriting TPLG parser based on Construct ([TEST#755](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof-test/pull/755)):

* use `apt` to install dependencies
* refine code
