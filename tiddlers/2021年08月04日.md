CI/Validation meetings:

* issue [SOF#4552](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/issues/4552)
  * failure when resume from runtime suspend, even not start `arecord`
  * every time the system resume, the 

Topology:

* multicore: for DSP
* the graph show the dataflow of the components, but the control flow maybe different
* PCM*P is a playback
* PCM*C is a capture
* BUF is internal buffer
* PGA, programmable gain amplifier
* MUXDEMUX is multiplex-demultiplex, like a selector to select  different pipeline
* SSP is a device contain both input (.IN) and output (.OUT)
* for wake on voice:
  * KPBM: 
  * DETECT:
  * when sleep, data will pass to DETECT.
  * while DETECT match the audio, it will control KPBM to switch the pipeline
  * It contains a history buffer, which can record frames in 2 seconds, so it can recover the

XRUN: underrun/overrun (audio buffer is a ring buffer)

* underrun:
  * ring buffer is empty, lack of products
  * maybe halt for playback
* overrun:
  * ring buffer is full, may not accept new data
  * may lost some frame for capture

Test Cases:

* `check-xrun-injection` force the system into XRUN, check the XRUN-recovery
* `check-keyword-detection` check wake on voice
* `simultaneous-playback-capture` for SSP device
