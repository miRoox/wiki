daily test results ([5901](https://sof-ci.sh.intel.com/#/result/planresultdetail/5901)) review:

* `sh-adls-rvp-hda-05` will report USB hub enable error after suspend resume.
  * Maybe we should filter `usb .+: Cannot enable. Maybe the USB cable is bad?`
  * Can't fix it, even replace a new mainboard, need more investigation.
* check-sof-logger/check-kmod-load-unload in `sh-adlp-rvp-hda-01`:
  * `error: Unable to open version file /sys/kernel/debug/sof/fw_version: No such file or directory `
  * `After 15s DSP status is: active`
  * maybe relate: <https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/issues/4333#issuecomment-869370242>
  * wait 60s will pass
  * i915 probe failure, affect DIM pipelines, need force probe:
    * edit system config `/etc/default/grub`,add `i915.force_probe=<id>` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`
      * actual id can be found in `dmesg` error log
      * or, add `options i915 force_probe=*` to `/etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf`
* playback in `sh-adlp-rvp-hda-01`:
  * aplay: set_params:1407: Unable to install hw params
  * error: ipc error for 0x80010000 size 12
    error: failed setting DAI config for HDA4.OUT
