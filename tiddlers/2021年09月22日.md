Daily test results review ([6697](https://sof-ci.sh.intel.com/#/result/planresultdetail/6697), [6710](https://sof-ci.sh.intel.com/#/result/planresultdetail/6710), [6739](https://sof-ci.sh.intel.com/#/result/planresultdetail/6739)):

* jf-tglu-rvp-nocodec-1: boot failed, file system corrupt
* sh-jsl-rvp-nocodec-01: `ata2.00: Read log page 0x08 failed, Emask 0x1`
  * replace the old SSD with a new one, and found that may be a regression from upstream: only happens on our daily kernel, but disappears on the generic kernel.
  * sh-jsl-rvp-nocodec-02 use an NVMe PCIe adapter, replacing with such an adapter may be a workaround.

parse and show component core ([TEST#768](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof-test/pull/768)):

* skip empty name/sname for nodes_dict
* allow show/hide core automatically
