Ansible playbook:

* Core components:

  * Hosts: remote hosts to run commands
    * Hosts syntax:
      * `a:b`: union of `a` and `b`
      * `a:&b`: intersect of `a` and `b`
      * `a:!b`: complement of `a` and `b`
    * `remote_user`  can under `host` or in task

  * Tasks: Task list
    * tasks will run sequentially
    * each task may have `name`
    * action form:
      * `action: <module> <args>`
      * `<module>: <args>` (prefer)

  * Variables: built-in variables or custom variables used by playbook

  * Templates: the files whose content will be substitute by variable

  * Handlers: used with notify. conditional actions.

  * Tags: specify the group of code which can be selected
