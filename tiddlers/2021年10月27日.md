Daily Test Review ([7688](https://sof-ci.sh.intel.com/#/result/planresultdetail/7688)): big regression break most of cases

> The root cause is that there’re some relations between PR [#4724](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/pull/4724) and PR [#4885](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/pull/4885).
>
> The PR test for [#4724](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/pull/4724) was based on sof commit [`1ef769d`](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/commit/1ef769dd87618eba93c7ca07f0613c346ecd4922), at that time [#4885](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/pull/4885) had not been merged，which make sense that the PR test passed.
>
> Then [#4724](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/pull/4724) merged before [#4885](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/pull/4885) and issue happened.
> I tried to revert [#4885](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/pull/4885) on top of main branch, issue cannot be reproduced any more.
