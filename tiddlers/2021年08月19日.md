daily test results review ([5946](https://sof-ci.sh.intel.com/#/result/planresultdetail/5946)):

* `jf-icl-rvp-hda-2` `alsabat`  low signal again, maybe relate to previous tests
  * run `check-sof-logger.sh`  before can reproduce
    * cannot reproduce in `sh-icl-rvp-hda-06`
    *run `sof_remove.sh` + setup `KERNEL_CHECKPOINT` manually + `sof_insert` independently will not cause the issue, but it can recover the firmware/device(?not sure) from the unexpected status and let the `alsabat` work fine
    * even `amixer contents` show the ALSA settings is correct, issue still found
    * run `sof-logger` independently will not cause the issue
    * however, replace `reload_drivers` call to `setup_kernel_check_point` in `check-sof-logger.sh`, and then run it, `alsabat` work fine
    * `kmod` unload-reload can reproduce this, but alternating: `kmod` once -> `alsabat` failed -> `kmod` twice -> `alsabat` pass -> loop
* `sh-adls-rvp-hda-06` `check-suspend-resume-with-capture-5.sh` :
  * ` kernel: e1000e 0000:00:1f.6 eno0: Hardware Error` maybe the problem of ethnics net on board
* `sh-adlp-rvp-hda-01` `check-keyword-detection` maybe setup a pipeline can fix it, or just disable it as WoV known issue
* `sh-apl-up2-nocodec-zephyr-01` `check-capture-all-formats` failed in daily test since 8/6/2021
* `jf-cml-hel-rt5682-01` `check-kmod-load-unload-25` timeout at last iteration, maybe time constraint is basically short for this device

rewriting TPLG parser based on Construct

* TODO: draft new PR

insight talk: <https://goto.intel.com/MyInsight>

* Make the memo for TODO list 
* overview the ALSA/SOF doc before Keyon's sharing next Monday
* Next time I will fill this myself
