daily test results review ([5931](https://sof-ci.sh.intel.com/#/result/planresultdetail/5931)):

* `jf-adlp-rvp-nocodec-7` timeout when suspend-resume, maybe the console buffer doesnot flush
* `jf-icl-rvp-hda-2` `alsabat`  low signal,
  * maybe:
    * physical disconnection
    * `amixer` setting incorrect or didn't apply immediately, some components are mute
  * can't reproduce

* check [SOF#4579](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/issues/4579#issuecomment-900442521)
  * failed in daily test since the previous test failed and DSP ran into an incorrect status
  * work well
