Daily test:

* ADLP_GMB_I2S_ZEPHYR:

  * [TEST#901](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof-test/issues/901) SKIP the DMA trace corruption might hide the failure. Many test cases report NA (SKIP) because the sof-logger was dead while the cases actually failed. 

  * [FW#5789](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/issues/5789) xrun after TRIG_PAUSE on ADLP_GMB_I2S_ZEPHYR when testing multiple pause resume.
