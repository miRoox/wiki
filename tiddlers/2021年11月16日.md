> Can I transfer my 1source access to my personal GitHub account? 
>
> Previously I have created a new GitHub account for work because I didn't know whether there are any side effects to my personal account. But recently I feel a little bit inconvenient to manage two GitHub accounts, so it is possible to transfer my access to my personal account so that I can [merge them into one](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/merging-multiple-user-accounts).
