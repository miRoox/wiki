! Introduction

The image widget displays images that can be specified as a remote URL or the title of a local tiddler containing the image.

! Content and Attributes

Any content of the `<$image>` widget is ignored.

|!Attribute |!Description |
|source |The URL of the image, or the title of an image tiddler |
|width |The width of the image |
|height |The height of the image |
|tooltip |The tooltip to be displayed over the image |
|alt |The alternative text to be associated with the image |
|class |CSS classes to be assigned to the `<img>` element |
|loading|<<.from-version "5.2.3">>Optional. Set to `lazy` to enable lazy loading of images loaded from an external URI |
|usemap|<<.from-version "5.3.2">>Optional usemap attribute to be assigned to the `<img>` element for use with HTML image maps |

The width and the height can be specified as pixel values (eg "23" or "23px") or percentages (eg "23%"). They are both optional; if not provided the browser will use CSS rules to size the image.

! Image Status Classes

<<from-version "5.2.2">> The following CSS classes are automatically added to the `<img>` element to indicate the status of the image. Note that only one of these classes will be added at the same time.

|''tc-image-loading'' |When the image is being loaded |
|''tc-image-loaded'' |The image has been loaded successfully |
|''tc-image-error'' |The image could not be loaded |

! External Images and the ''_canonical_uri'' field

When used to display tiddler-based images, the image widget operates in two distinct modes:

* If the ''_canonical_uri'' field is present then it is used as the ''src'' attribute of the generated `<img>` element and the ''text'' field is ignored
* Without the ''_canonical_uri'' field, the image widget generates an `<img>` element that embeds the image data directly using a `data:` URI.

See ExternalImages for more details.
