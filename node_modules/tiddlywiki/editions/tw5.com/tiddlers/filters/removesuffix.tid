caption: removesuffix
op-purpose: filter the input titles by how they end, deleting that suffix
op-input: a [[selection of titles|Title Selection]]
op-parameter: a string of characters
op-parameter-name: S
op-output: those input titles that end with <<.place S>>, but with those characters discarded
op-suffix: the <<.op removesuffix>> operator uses a rich suffix, see below for details

<<.tip " This filters out input titles that do not end with S. For removing S without filtering out input titles that don't end with S, see [[trim|trim Operator]].">>

<<.from-version "5.2.2">>

The <<.op removesuffix>> operator uses an extended syntax that permits multiple flags to be passed:

```
[removesuffix:<flag list>[<operand>]]
```

* ''flag list'': a comma delimited list of flags
* ''operand'': filter operand

The available flags are:

* ''casesensitive'': (default), this flag forces a case-sensitive match, where upper and lower case letters are considered different
* ''caseinsensitive'': overrides the default so that upper and lower case letters are considered identical for matching purposes
