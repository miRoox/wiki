An add-on for Google Drive that allows TiddlyWiki files stored there to be opened and saved directly

To find out how to add it to your account, go to the project's info page:

I made an app that lets one edit TiddlyWiki files saved in your Google drive and then saving them back automagically. The page is here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tiddly-drive/oaphhjhbbabdjnpjpiliepphpmnioolo but I think you need to add it from the Google Drive web interface.

I even added an optional ability to save with ctrl + s hotkeys.
