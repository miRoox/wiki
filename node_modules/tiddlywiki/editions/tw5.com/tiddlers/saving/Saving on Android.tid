The Tiddloid or Tiddloid Lite app for Android devices makes it possible to edit and save changes to TiddlyWiki. Get it from GitHub: [[Tiddloid|https://github.com/donmor/Tiddloid]] [[Tiddloid Lite|https://github.com/donmor/TiddloidLite]].

''Instructions for use:''

# [[Download]] an empty TiddlyWiki on another web browser
# Move the file you just downloaded to the directory `/sdcard/andtidwiki`
#* You may rename it, but be sure to keep the `.html` or `.htm` extension
# Open AndTidWiki
#* Don't use ''Menu''/''new ~TiddlyWiki'' menu option (it only supports the older TiddlyWikiClassic)
# Open the file by touching its filename
# Try creating a new tiddler using the ''new tiddler'' <<.icon $:/core/images/new-button>> button in the sidebar. Type some content for the tiddler, and click the <<.icon $:/core/images/done-button>> ''ok'' button
#* The wiki will be saved, and a confirmation message should appear at the top right of the window

''Note:'' You can save your changes by clicking the <<.icon $:/core/images/save-button>> ''save changes'' button in the sidebar even if you have not clicked the <<.icon $:/core/images/done-button>> ''ok'' button to complete editing a tiddler

*  Tiddloid Lite supports new devices better. It also supports files on clouds like GDrive and ~OneDrive, while Tiddloid keeps the compatibility to TiddlyWikiClassic. For more difference between Tiddloid and  Tiddloid Lite, please visit [[Tiddloid's homepage|https://github.com/donmor/Tiddloid]].
* You should keep the `.html` or `.htm` extension of the files to be imported.
